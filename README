# Arbitrary Haskell #

This Haskell library provides an instance of QuickCheck's `Arbitrary` typeclass,
which produces `String`s of Haskell code.

Specifically, we define `newtype Haskell = H String`, and give it an instance of
`Arbitrary` which orchestrates the generation of well-typed Haskell expressions
(using the `haskell-generate` library) then pretty-prints the results.
